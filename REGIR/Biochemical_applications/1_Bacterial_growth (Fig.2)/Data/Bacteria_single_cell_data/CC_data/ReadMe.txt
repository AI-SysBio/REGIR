In this folder we provide 8 data tables of single cell growth data for C. crescentus cells. See Iyer-Biswas et al. “Scaling laws governing stochastic growth and division of single bacterial cells”, PNAS 111(45) 15912-15917 (2014) for explanation of the variables and the measurement and analysis procedures. In particular, see Figures 2A and 2B of the main text.

The column designations of the variables for each file are listed below in the format: {Column 1, Column 2}. “Tau” is single cell division time; “KappaInv” is the inverse of the single cell exponential growth rate; “a0” is the size of a cell immediately following division (initial size); and “aTau” is the size of a cell just prior to division (final size).
